# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component
## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Heyy!! So I completed this challenge of making  3-column preview card component.. I didn't make it too responsive  , for all the breakpoints and I guess its fine the way it is.. I used flexbox and CSS Custom properties to build this, the onlt thing that budged me ,was, that I wrote some unneccessary lines of code for declaring color ids and classes, while making it responsive I went with desktop first..  and yeah thats it !! 

Feel free to comment on my soln it'll help me improve... Thanks for your feedback
