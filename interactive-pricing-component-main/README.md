<b>I didnt focus much on style , or the HTML structure , primarily because my I couldn't style my input tag</b> , for which I had to install <b>noUIslider.js</b>, which I had nvr worked with ðŸ¤¯ , so naturally I grabbed some help from <b>GPT</b> ðŸ¤–,so yea . . . after wasting my time on it I pretty much didnt want to pay much attention to detail.
<h2>Regarding JS . . .</h2>
At first I was concerned with how would I make it interactive but it turns out that it wasn't much of a deal, a simple JS logic at work , nothing else
I might redo this in future for some slider animations but I guess this is ok for now

Here's a preview if it doesn't work on your device(I hope it does) . . . **cheers !!ðŸ¥‚**
