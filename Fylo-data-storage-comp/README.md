### What I learned

**Hey !!!!!!** This was my take on the challenge...I've added a slight animation to make it look more interesting....don't bother looking at my code I overdid flexbox.., I found a lil trouble while positioning the triangle(speech bubble),.like it looks good on big viewport but as soon as you switch it to any other viewport (except 375px), it starts losing its position....besides that I think I've done okay-ish job..
