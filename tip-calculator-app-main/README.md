## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned
- styling input tags , especially removing there in-buit button thru pseudo classes
- I also got to know that there is a ```button type = "reset"```, like I didn't know before ðŸ˜…
- working with setInterval and adding the number animation after the values are input

### Continued development

While working with this project I discovered about ```eval()``` function in string library as well as```event.target```, but it was too late , I had already worked on the logic by then. I would also try using the ``` setInterval``` more in my projects.
